# Rotorflight

Rotorflight is a Flight Control software suite for single-rotor helicopters.

It is based on Betaflight 4.3, with many advanced features added for helicopters.
Rotorflight does **NOT** support multi-rotor crafts, nor airplanes; it is only for traditinal RC helicopters.

**WARNING!** Rotorflight is **WORK-IN-PROGRESS**. Please talk to the authors if you want to participate in the
development effort!


## Information

For latest information, please see [Rotorflight Wiki](https://github.com/rotorflight/rotorflight/wiki)


## Features

Rotorflight has many features:

* PID control tuned for helicopter use
* Fully customisable feedforward between collective/cyclic/yaw
* Rotor speed governor
* Advanced gyro filtering for helicopters
  - Advanced dynamic LPF
  - Dynamic RPM based notch filter banks
* Fully customisable servo/motor mixer
* Flexible servo configuration
* Irrelevant (multi-rotor) features removed

Plus lots of features inherited from Betaflight:

* Configuration profiles for changing various tuning parameters
* Multi-color RGB LEDs
* Configurable buzzer sounds
* Multiple ESC protocols: DShot (150,300,600), Multishot, Oneshot, and traditional PWM
* Multiple ESC telemetry protocols: KISS, HW
* Multiple RX telemetry protocols: CSRF, FrSky, HoTT, MSP, etc.
* Voltage inputs for RSSI, battery voltage, current sensors, etc.
* Fully integrated OSD
* Fully integrated video TX control (Unify Pro, IRC Tramp, etc.)

And many more...


## Hardware support

Generally speaking, Rotorflight supports all flight controller hardware that is supported by Betaflight.
With a caveat that the flight controller must have enough suitable I/O pins for connecting all the servos
and motors required by a collective pitch helicopter.

Also, the FC boards are typically labeled for multi-rotor use - thus the user needs to understand how these
functions can be used for a different purpose with helicopters. Usually this is just about using some
of the motor outputs for servos, but in some cases a more advanced remapping may be needed.

It is highly recommended to use a STM32F7 based flight controller, as Rotorflight greatly benefits from
the latest filtering algorithms and other new features that are all CPU intensive.

An absolute minimum is a STM32F4 based board, but it probably won't be able to run all the new features.
